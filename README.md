# Meetapp Mobile

> Mobile Frontend (in React Native) of the [meetapp backend app](https://github.com/psatler/meetapp-backend)

### Running the app via USB

**DISCLAIMER**: This was tested on an Android device only.

You got to have your phone with `Developer Options` enabled first.

To actually run the application on the phone:

```
npx react-native run-android
react-native start
```

You can check if the Android phone is connected by running:

```
adb devices
```

### Acknowledments

To create the basis of this project with Typescript the following command was used:
```
npx --ignore-existing react-native init meetapp_mobile --template react-native-template-typescript
```
When not being able to start a brand new typescript project, run with the `--ignore-existing` flag. This is further explained [here](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-template-typescript/issues/80).
Though, to definitely fix this, uninstall the old react native CLi and install the new one `@react-native-community/cli`:
```
npm uninstall -g react-native-cli
npm install -g @react-native-community/cli
```
After that, you would be able to start a brand new project without using the flag.

# Meetapp Mobile

> Mobile Frontend for users (in React Native) of the [meetapp backend app](https://github.com/psatler/meetapp-backend)

This application is built with the React Native CLI. It consumes the API implemented at [this repository](https://github.com/psatler/meetapp-backend).

This is the mobile frontend, where the user can subscribe to the meetups and see the meetups they have subscribed to.
The web frontend is where the organizers can created meetups, filling out pieces of information such as meetup name, description and location as well as uploading a banner for it.

This app has tools configured such as ESLint, Redux, Redux Saga, Reactotron, Storybookjs. It also uses the Typescript template of React Native. It has some features implemented as
Infinite Scroll on the _Dashboard_ screen (the Home one) as well as _pull to refresh_ to refresh and update the list coming from the backend. The user can update their information
such as password, email and user name on the app at the _Profile_ screen.

# Meetapp Mobile

> Mobile Frontend for users (in React Native) of the [meetapp backend app](https://github.com/psatler/meetapp-backend)

This application is built with the React Native CLI. It consumes the API implemented at [this repository](https://github.com/psatler/meetapp-backend).

This is the mobile frontend, where the user can subscribe to the meetups and see the meetups they have subscribed to.
The [web frontend](https://github.com/psatler/meetapp-frontend) is where the organizers can created meetups, filling out pieces of information such as meetup name, description and location as well as uploading a banner for it.

This app has tools configured such as ESLint, Redux, Redux Saga, Reactotron, Storybookjs. It also uses the Typescript template of React Native. It has some features implemented as
Infinite Scroll on the _Dashboard_ screen (the Home one) as well as _pull to refresh_ to refresh and update the list coming from the backend. The user can update their information
such as password, email and user name on the app at the _Profile_ screen.

### Running the app via USB

**DISCLAIMER**: This was tested on an Android device only.

You got to have your phone with `Developer Options` enabled first.

To actually run the application on the phone:

```
npx react-native run-android
npx react-native start
```

You can check if the Android phone is connected by running:

```
adb devices
```

You can install Reactotron and use it to switch between the App screen and Storybook screens.

The following is usually used to get Reactotron connected to the application for debugging purposes:
```
adb reverse tcp:9090 tcp:9090
```
and then, reload the app with 'r'






### Screens of the app

At this section you can see some gifs of the app working and some screenshots as well. They were taken/recorded from
an Android Nexus 4 Simulator with the _Record and Playback_ option of the simulator and later **had its size reduced**, which
in turn made a decrease in the quality of them.
